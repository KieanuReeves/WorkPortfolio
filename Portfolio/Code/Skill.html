            <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
            <div class="detailstext">
                <P>
                    ðŸ’¡ What is it?<br>
HTML is the backbone of web development. It defines the structure and content of web pages using a system of elements and tags.<br>
ðŸ”§ How it relates to Computer Engineering?<br>
Foundation of Web Development: As a Computer Engineering student, understanding HTML allows you to create user interfaces for web-based applications, IoT dashboards, and embedded system control panels.<br>
Integration with Embedded Systems: In some projects, HTML is used in web-based control systems where microcontrollers (like ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi) serve a webpage to interact with hardware.<br>
Software Engineering Practices: Many firmware development tools use web-based UIs built with HTML, helping you create interfaces for monitoring real-time hardware data.<br>
ðŸš€ Example Applications<br>
Designing a monitoring system UI for an IoT project.<br>
Creating a simple web-based control panel for a smart home system.<br>
Developing a firmware update page for embedded devices.<br>
                </P>
            </div>

            <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <div class="detailstext">
                <p>
                    ðŸ’¡ What is it?<br>
CSS is used to style and design web pages, making them visually appealing by controlling layout, colors, typography, and animations.<br>
ðŸ”§ How it relates to Computer Engineering?<br>
Enhancing Web-Based UI for Embedded Systems: When working on IoT projects, CSS allows you to create clear, user-friendly interfaces for controlling hardware (e.g., an interactive dashboard to monitor sensor data).<br>
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): As a Computer Engineering student, knowledge of CSS ensures that your software or embedded applications provide an intuitive user experience (UX).<br>
Front-End Development for Engineering Tools: CSS can be used to design custom interfaces for tools like real-time analytics dashboards in microcontroller-based systems.<br>
ðŸš€ Example Applications<br>
Styling a real-time sensor dashboard for monitoring CPU temperature.<br>
Creating a control panel for an IoT system (e.g., smart home automation).<br>
Designing a user-friendly interface for an embedded web server project.<br>
                </p>

            <h2>Electronics</h2>
            <div class="detailstext">
                <p>
                    ðŸ’¡ What is it?<br>
Electronics is the study of circuits, semiconductors, microcontrollers, and embedded systems. It is essential for designing and troubleshooting hardware components.<br>
ðŸ”§ How it relates to Computer Engineering?<br>
Hardware-Software Integration: Electronics knowledge allows you to interface sensors and actuators with software applications, essential for robotics, IoT, and embedded systems.<br>
Circuit Design & Debugging: You can design, analyze, and troubleshoot circuits, which is crucial when working with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, FPGA, or other microcontrollers.<br>
Power & Signal Processing: Understanding digital logic circuits, power systems, and signal transmission is fundamental in networking, system architecture, and hardware development.<br>
ðŸš€ Example Applications<br>
Building and programming a microcontroller-based system (e.g., a smart irrigation system).<br>
Designing a digital logic circuit for a hardware security system.<br>
Developing a hardware-software interface for biometric authentication.<br>
